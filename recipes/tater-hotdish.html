    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        To make this recipe, you’ll need these simple ingredients: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen cut green beans, thawed</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen sweet corn, thawed</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's)</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Set a large deep cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add olive oil and swirl to coat skillet evenly. 
            Add onions to skillet in one even layer; top with ground beef, 
            breaking it up into small pieces. Cook undisturbed until onions are translucent, 
            about 2 minutes. Stir beef and onions until well combined, and cook until beef 
            is cooked through and browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Season beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. 
            Cook, stirring often, for 1 more minute. Remove from heat. 
            Add cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and corn; stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Toss tater tots and seasoned salt in a bowl to combine. 
            Arrange tater tots decoratively over beef mixture in the skillet, 
            avoiding large gaps between tots.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tater tots are golden and crisp, about 1 hour. 
            Sprinkle with cheese and scallions; cool 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
